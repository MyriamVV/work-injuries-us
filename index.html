<div class="intro">


    <p>After United States citizens went into lock down in 2020, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) documented a decrease in work-related injuries from 2019. </p> 

    <p>Although this would seem like a positive outcome of the pandemic, it also became a source of concern about how to address work injuries. If the accident happened at home but during working hours, should it be covered? What about if there were no witnesses?</p>

     <p>According to experts from Bricker & Eckler Attorneys at law, if the injury didn’t occur when the employee was doing a task for the employer, “the remote injury is less likely to be compensable.” But the debate keeps going.</p>
